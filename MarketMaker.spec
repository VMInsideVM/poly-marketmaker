# coincurve is the one that bites: eth_keys picks its ECC backend at runtime via
# `import coincurve` inside is_coincurve_available(), and coincurve's actual crypto
# lives in two cffi-generated extensions (_libsecp256k1, _cffi_backend) that static
# analysis does not follow. Half-collected, the package lands in an inconsistent
# state where is_coincurve_available() answers True once (so CoinCurveECCBackend is
# selected) and False on the very next call inside its __init__ — which is exactly
# the "requires the coincurve library which is not available for import" error that
# broke API construction 644 times in the 2026-07-29 logs. collect_dynamic_libs is
# no help here: the binaries are .pyd, so they ride along as sub-modules instead.
